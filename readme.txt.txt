This is a personal hobby project i started last year. 

I had a goal of 5 games, 3 are complete, after the 5 are complete I have the deisre to add more.

operational games: Poker (5 card stud), Roulette, and Black Jack

games in progress: Craps and Baccarat

games i am considering: Hi/Low, Number Guess, and a Slot Machine



Run the program on a linux based system with the following commands:

compile first with:

g++ casino.cpp -std=c++11 -o casino

then run with:

./casino

*note* the -std=c++11 is for the compiler to add the appropriate libraries.
       this is not required on all linux systems
